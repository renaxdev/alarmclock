# Alarmclock

At school, we have to do a small project using Arduinos.
We thought about making a small Alarm Clock with a Temperature/Humidity-Showing feature.

## Circuit

All resistors in here are 10kΩ. I just messed up while making the circuit diagram lol

## Used Parts
- DHT11
- 2x 10kΩ Resistors
- 2x Buttons
- Arduino Nano
- Active Piezo
- RTC Module (DS1302 IC)
- 16x2 LCD Display with i2c Module


## Development Phase
Changes can be made. Dont upload yet.
I will notify you, if the program is ready to use
